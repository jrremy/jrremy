## Hey there, I'm Jeremy! üëã

üë®‚Äçüíª I'm a computer science student with a passion for problem-solving and software engineering. I'm always exploring various niches out there, but as of now I have experience in full-stack web development with JavaScript and Python as well as programming in Java and C++.

üîç I place heavy emphasis on making technology accessible to everyone, regardless of background or physical capability. In 2024, I worked on my own project called SemantifyHTML. It's a full-stack web tool built with React.js and Python that aims to transform non-semantic HTML into code that is more readable by computers. Semantic HTML practices make the web more accessible by those using accessibility features, as well as improving search engine optimization (SEO).

ü§ù Aside from personal projects, I love collaborating with others! I build full-stack web apps at Uptick, a startup based in NY. I also contribute to open-source projects such as Reflex, a Python web framework I use at work.
